# To-do list!

This is a **to-do list** type project made using javascript.


## About this project
This project was made using js, in it, you are able to *add* new to-dos, *check* to-dos as completed, and *delete* any to-dos. The project also saves your to-dos in **localStorage** so closing the page won't make you loose them.

- I also used the framework Bootstrap to create the navigation bar.


## Objective
I've been trying to do more pratical projects to put into practice what i've already leraned, but also so i can challenge myself to keep learning more. This was good javascript practive, as i'm still a begginer and the best way i find to advance my habilities is to do small projects such as this one for now.
